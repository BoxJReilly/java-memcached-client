<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:9&amp;chl=Raghavan" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.8.4

The 2.8.4 release of spymemcached has only a
single bugfix for handling some issues with the
observe command introduced in 2.8.3.  The observe
command is for use with Couchbase Server only.

The 2.8.3 release is a minor update to spymemcached which
includes a bug fix and some minor new features in support
of Couchbase Server in the Couchbase Java Client project
which depends on some protocol capabilities and handling
in this project.

Note that SPY-97 was opened for unlock, as the fix
described above doesn't address situations where there
is a TMPFAIL or a NOT_MY_VBUCKET, for example.

Summary of changes by contributor:

Raghavan Srinivas (3):
      Adding a getCas() for Store functions
      Changes for Observe.
      Fixed failing Unlock test

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:fZG&amp;chl=Matt%7cMike%7cMarty" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.8.2

The 2.8.2 release is a minor update to spymemcached which
includes bug fixes and a workaround to recently discovered
issues.  The major workaround included in this release is
that optimization has been disabled.  Recent tests
indicate that there is a problem with optimization in the
ascii implementation that may cause operations to come
back with a cache miss prematurely.  Further, it was found
on binary protocol that an error in the middle of binary
optimization pipelined sets, it can cause lack of recovery
on the client.

To address these two correctness issues, optimization is
now off by default, but may be enabled to make the client
behave like it had previously.  It is expected that
optimization will be re-enabled in the next release.

There were also minor bugfixes for logging, some internal
utilities, and handling of certain error cases.

Summary of changes by contributor:

Matt Ingenthron (11):
      Change vbucket retry logging to debug level. SPY-87
      Make queueReconnect protected so subclasses can request reconnects.
      Make the OperationState volatile.  SPY-88
      Add javadoc for OperationFuture.
      Comment correction in MemcachedConnection.  Non-javadoc.
      Let offline try to work with already downloaded mvn.
      Correct test for StringUtils.join().
      Disable optimization by default, remove assert. SPY-88.
      Revert ErrorCode and OperationStatus changes.
      Change selection key logging to debug level.
      Fixed misc checkstyle errors which crept in.

Mike Wiederhold (9):
      Retry not my vbucket error for optimized sets. SPY-88
      Fixed tap message test cases
      Create an ErrorCode class for error codes
      OperationStatus now has an error code
      Check if op is null before asserting in OperationFuture

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:yFCBBBB&amp;chl=Mike%7cMatt%7cRaghavan%7cDustin%7cPaul%7cPaul%7cOther" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.8.0

The 2.8.0 release is a minor update to spymemcached which
includes bug fixes, some minor new features and some
features split out into a separate project.

Starting in the 2.8.0 release, there is no longer support
directly in the MemcachedClient object for Membase Server.
That has been broken out into a separate library which is
hosted at http://www.couchbase.com/develop/java/current

By separating out that code, it reduced the dependency
burden on this project.  Also, a number of the proposed
new features, namely support for Couchbase Server views
seemed increasingly like they did not belong in this
project.

The new project should be compatible with minimal,
though some, code changes.  It is Open Source under an
Apache 2.0 license, and support of that library continues
by the same developers.

This new release also includes Iterator versions of
getAsyncBulk and getBulk.

For example:

    public PrefixAdderIterator implements Iterator<String> {

      private final String prefix;
      private final Iterator<String> iterator;
      public PrefixAdderIterator(String prefix,
             Iterator<String> iterator) {
        this.prefix = prefix;
        this.iterator = iterator;
      }
      ...
      public String next() {
        return prefix+iterator.next();
      }
     ...
    }

    rather than

     List<String> prefixedKeys = new ArrayList<String>();
     for (String key: keys) {
      prefixedKeys.add(prefix+key);
     }

Thanks much to Ted Crossman for the idea and
contribution.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:9&amp;chl=Matt" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.7.3

The 2.7.3 release is a patch update, covering just one issue
which was intended to be in 2.7.2.

It's issue 181 (also SPY-60) and has to do with continuing
to search for another server in the list provided if one
server appears to be down.

Summary of changes since the 2.6 series:
(see previous 2.7 release notes for more details)

The 2.7 series gains significant new capabilities when using
binary protocol with Membase or forthcoming updates to
memcached.

Starting with the 2.7 release, it is now possible to
instantiate a MemcachedClient from the REST interface
supported by Membase.  What this means is that if you have
one or more buckets in Membase, you can create
MemcachedClient objects to work with the buckets.  Furthermore,
if the cluster topology changes (i.e. a node is added or
removed), the client will automatically adjust to the new
topology.

This updated client also has support for other new Membase
operations, some of which will likely be in memcached
as well in a future release:
  touch - extend the expiration for a given item
  get and touch (a.k.a. gat) - get and touch an item
  getl - get and lock an item, with a lock expiration time

</pre></div><h2>Changes from release 2.7.1 to 2.7.2</h2>
<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:vFFCC&amp;chl=Mike%7cDaniel%7cMatt%7cMartin%7csanada0670" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.7.2

The 2.7.2 release is a patch update, including a number of new
features.

The 2.7.1 release introduced a required dependency update of
Apache commons codec.  A more elegant solution has been added
to this release so we can now use commons-code 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5.
There is also a more elegant solution to the unfortunate
incompatibility introduced in Netty, where 3.2 changed the
signature of one method.  Thanks to Martin Grotzke for this fix.

Some notable bugs fixed in this release include:
* BaseSerializingTranscode resource leak (issue 190)
* Operation class is used in un-threadsafe, unsynchronized manner
  (issue 195)
* decodeLong() would decode incorrectly and prematurely wrap
  (issue 202)

The development time experience is better starting in 2.7.1.  Classic
"buildr test" will work just as expected, but it will run only the
subset of tests that are appropriate for memcached.  Using some
environment variables, tests can be run against Membase either locally
or remotely or against a remote memcached.

Examples:

Run tests against a Membase instance on the localhost:

  buildr test SPYMC_SERVER_TYPE="membase"

Run memcached IPv4 tests and try to run IPv6 tests against the specified server:

  buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58"

Run a test against the specified IPv4 and IPv6 servers:

  buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58" SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6=
    "some_ipv6_addr"

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:uIDBBB&amp;chl=Mike%7cMatt%7cDustin%7cNelz%7cPaul%7cVitaly" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.7.1

The 2.7.1 release is a patch update, including a number of new
features.  It should be compatible with all 2.7 deployments, with one
dependency update required if deployed as a Membase 'smart client'.

There are also a number of new features in this release: operation
status visibility, a built in TAP client, and new configuration
options when using Membase.

In the past, when an async operation completed, success or failure
could be determined but the reason for a success or failure wasn't
clear.  Now many of these methods return an OperationFuture instead of
simply a Future and have a new method called getStatus().  The
OperationStatus can then offer more insight as to what happened with
the operation.

This release also sports a new TAP client.  TAP is a method of either
streaming changed items or 'dumping' all items from a Membase cluster.
This allows for new ways to get information on changes occurring to, or
analyze the data from a Membase cluster.  Notably, this technique is
used in the Hadoop Sqoop integration with Membase.  You may read more
about TAP here:
http://docs.couchbase.org/membase-manual-1.7.1/membase-architecture.html
http://docs.couchbase.org/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-faq.html

Another minor new feature, one can now specify a ConnectionFactory
when connecting to a Membase cluster (for either memcached or Membase
bucket types).  This allows for more specific configuration of things
like default timeout, reconnect delay, use of optimization, etc.

Some notable bugs fixed in this release include:
* ClassCastException (spymemcached issue 96)
* Bulk operations with Membase (VbucketNodeLocator)
* Made client more stable under Membase topology changes
* ASCII operations now return a false operation status on failure

The aforementioned dependency update is to bring Apache Commons Codec
up to 1.5, owing to a bug introduced in 1.4.  We had worked around
that bug, but the project decided to go back to what had been
implemented in commons-codec 1.3.  This meant we were dependent on a
very specific version of commons-codec.  We've now rolled forward
following the recommendations from Apache Commons Codec.  This
requires a dependency update.

The development time experience is better in this update.  Classic
"buildr test" will work just as expected, but it will run only the
subset of tests that are appropriate for memcached.  Using some
environment variables, tests can be run against Membase either locally
or remotely or against a remote memcached.

Examples:

Run tests against a Membase instance on the localhost:

  buildr test SPYMC_SERVER_TYPE="membase"

Run memcached IPv4 tests and try to run IPv6 tests against the specified server:

  buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58"

Run a test against the specified IPv4 and IPv6 servers:

  buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58" SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6=
    "some_ipv6_addr"

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:eRJEC&amp;chl=Matt%7cAlexander%7cMike%7cDustin%7cLuke" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.7

Changes since the 2.6 series:

The 2.7 series gains significant new capabilities when using
binary protocol with Membase or forthcoming updates to
memcached.

Starting with the 2.7 release, it is now possible to
instantiate a MemcachedClient from the REST interface
supported by Membase.  What this means is that if you have
one or more buckets in Membase, you can create
MemcachedClient objects to work with the buckets.  Furthermore,
if the cluster topology changes (i.e. a node is added or
removed), the client will automatically adjust to the new
topology.

This updated client also has support for other new Membase
operations, some of which will likely be in memcached
as well in a future release:
  touch - extend the expiration for a given item
  get and touch (a.k.a. gat) - get and touch an item
  getl - get and lock an item, with a lock expiration time

See http://www.couchbase.org/documentation for further
details.

Many other minor changes were introduced in support of
this work, like handling temporary failures.  Notably,
this affects testing in that you now need a Membase
server running locally with a specific username
and password.  This is a limitation planned for removal
in future releases.

Some of these changes affected interfaces, which is why
the version number has been raised to 2.7 even though
2.6 was just recently released.

To support this new functionality, there are a few new
runtime dependencies:
netty 3.1.5 GA
jettison 1.1
Apache commons-codec 1.4

These are only required if you are using the new REST
interface and topology changes from Membase.

The majority of contributions to this release were
funded by Couchbase, Inc.  Thanks to the contributors:

Changes since the 2.5 series:

The major change, and the reason for the version bump, is that timeout
handling has been improved.  Previously, timed out operations may have
actually been written to the network even after they'd timed out.  The
change required some small API changes (generally forward compatible
so minor version bump only) and adds a new operation state of timedout.

Other changes include performance enhancements, transcoder enahncements
and improvements in the continuious timeout counter to be per
connection rather than for the entire MemcachedClient.  The library is
now easier to use in Spring as well, owing to a FactoryBean contribution.

Between rc1 and rc2, a major issue (issue 175) with the
KetamaNodeLocator was found, so some changes were backported along with
the fix.

</pre></div><h2>Changes from release 2.5rc3 to 2.6</h2>
<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:fMHEBBE&amp;chl=Matt%7cBlair%7cDustin%7cBoris%7cAndrey%7cddlatham%7cOther" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.6

Changes since the 2.5 series:

The main change in 2.6 is logic with respect to timeout handling.
Timeout default is now 2500ms, rather than the old default of
1000ms.  The reason for this change is that a single network
retransmit could cause a longer than 1000ms wait, causing an
exception in the client application.

Additionally, some changes were integrated that help the client to
recover faster when a network connection problem does occur.  These
changes required interface changes, which is why the version has
been bumped to 2.6.

This change also allows client code to be able to tell if an
operation has timed out after being sent over the network or if
it has timed out before even being written to the network.

See issue 136 for more discussions on this topic.

Another feature relating to timeouts is that the continuous
timeout feature introduced in 2.5 has been moved to the connection
level, rather than for an entire client.  The default is that after
1000 timeout operations, a connection will be dropped and
reestablished if possible.  This addresses situations where a server
may fail, but the connection is not reset.

There are also performance improvements and new transcoder abilities
with asyncGetBulk now included.

One other significant bug fixed in this release was a problem with
finding an active node when there is a failed node and the
KetamaNodeLocator is in use.  With only two nodes, the previous
implementation had a 25% chance of not finding a working node
and failing with a timeout.  This has been changed such that now
there is a less than 1% chance it will not find a working node.

It should be noted that spy's algorithm here may be different
than libketama.  This is tracked under issue 117.  This is not a
new change however, and it's never been reported from running in
production.

Thanks much to all of the new contributors to this release!  Thanks
in particular to Taso of Concur who spent much time writing tests
to isolate issue 175.

Changes since the 2.4 series:

The main new feature of the 2.5 release is support for SASL auth
to go along with the same feature in the memcached 1.4.3 and later
servers.

There is also a new feature which can be used in conjunction with the
failure cancel mode to close all connections to memcached servers if
there are timeouts against a server.  This helps to recover from
situations where a memcached server in the list may hard fail.

The reason for rc3, and the significant changes over rc2, is that
a number of issues were found where operations could be sent without
allowing SASL to complete.

Also notable is this commit:
cba26c1 If the String value of the socket address starts with a /, remove it.

This does affect Ketama hashing, as it was found there could be some
occasional mismatch with libketama.  A much larger test was added
and to a pretty large degree, compatibility with libketama's hashing is
assured.  Proceed with caution if you'll be running a mixed environment
of 2.5 and pre-2.5 spymemcached clients.  To get the old behavior by
default, a custom interface is easily implemented.

Additionally, there have been a number of bug fixes, comment cleanups
some new tests, and some consistency fixes.

Changes since 2.4.2:

Ahn Seong Hwa (2):
      New TCP connection timeout feature; if server fails completely, d/c.
      fix for useless check statement that is for continuous timeout exception counter

Blair Zajac (3):
      Be more generous in the strings that AddrUtil#getAddresses() will parse.
      Fix AddrUtilTest#testIPv6Host() hostname assertion.
      Fix consistency issue in ConnectionFactoryBuilder.isDaemon()

Dustin Sallings (19):
      Beginnings of SASL support.
      A slightly better model for SASL auth.
      Authentication should allow specification of a mechanism.
      Refactored broadcast to allow for node selection.
      Working multi-step auth.
      Refactored SASL auth for greater reuse.
      Added support for listing SASL mechanisms.
      Reformatted callback handler.
      Don't throw away an exception.
      Use the socket address as the realm.
      Better auth API, handles connection drops.
      Log the bug that causes reconnection on first connect.
      Replaced Long nanos with long millis for op queue block offer timeout.
      Ensure the factory builder can be used to specify enqueue block size.
      Get rid of special constructors for op enqueue timeouts.
      Do blocking inserts from the cache loader test.
      Auth fix for mechanisms that have an initial response.
      If the String value of the socket address starts with a /, remove it.
      A larger libketama extract for compatibility testing.

      Clarify what is planned after a disconnect.
      Enhance MemcachedNode to know whether auth should happen.
      Changed AuthTest description to match reality.
      Manual test to ensure correct connection handling with SASL.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:" alt="contributors"/><pre>Prerelease of 2.4

Changes since the 2.3 series.

Bug Fixes:

* Memcached node tracking.
  When a timeout occurs on an operation, the exception indicates the
  server node that was the intendend recipient of the operation.
* Fixed reconnect loss on multiple simultaneous connection failures.
  This is a rare occurrence, but the wrong thing would happen if two
  simultaneous reconnects were requeued for any reason.
* Fixed a race condition that occurred when tearing down a connection.
  There was a case where shutting down a connection would cause an NPE
  to get logged due to the a race between a selector check and the
  selector being shut down.  Unlikely to affect a running app, but
  it was still wrong.
* Handle initial connect failures.
  There were rare cases where an async connect would error instantly
  on the first attempt, but that connect wouldn't be retried.

Features:

* ConnectionFactoryBuilder
  Rather than having to build a custom subclass of
  DefaultConnectionFactory to override behaviors, you can now use a
  ConnectionFactoryBuilder to easily assemble a ConnectionFactory as
  you want it.
* Mutation-only CAS mutator
  Previously, the CASMutator required an initial object to use if the
  object you were attempting to mutate wasn't found.  Now you can
  specify this as NULL and CASMutator will *only* mutate an existing
  object, but never create a new one.
* CacheLoader
  CacheLoader provides a couple of convenient mechanisms for
  efficiently loading bulk data.  I've seen many benchmarks trying to
  see how fast data can go into memcached through the client (as
  opposed to normal usage), but they do things to make it
  unnecessarily slow.  This should satisfy both benchmarking
  requirements and legitimate bulk loading requirements.

Performance Enhancements:

* Disable Nagle Algorithm by Default
  The usage of the Nagle algorithm (tcpNoDelay) is now configurable
  and is configured off by default (Nagle algorithm off = tcpNoDelay
  on).  This should be more optimal for most configurations.
* Multi-set Escalation in the Binary Protocol
  With no changes to the API, multiple sequential sets will be
  escalated into a multi-set operation similar to multi-get.  In a
  bulk load test, this is generally around 2x faster.
* Asynchronous Transcoding Service
  A transcoder can request a transcoder service (effectively a
  threadpool) to asynchronously decode cache response objects both
  outside of the API and outside of the caller thread.

Changes since the 2.3 series.

Bug Fixes:

* Memcached node tracking.
  When a timeout occurs on an operation, the exception indicates the
  server node that was the intendend recipient of the operation.
* Fixed reconnect loss on multiple simultaneous connection failures.
  This is a rare occurrence, but the wrong thing would happen if two
  simultaneous reconnects were requeued for any reason.
* Fixed a race condition that occurred when tearing down a connection.
  There was a case where shutting down a connection would cause an NPE
  to get logged due to the a race between a selector check and the
  selector being shut down.  Unlikely to affect a running app, but
  it was still wrong.
* Handle initial connect failures.
  There were rare cases where an async connect would error instantly
  on the first attempt, but that connect wouldn't be retried.
* Sequence number wrapping bug.
  If you sent more than 2 billion or so requests to a node, the client
  would find itself in an infinite loop trying to cmoe up with a new
  opaque value.
* Suboptimal back-off algorithm.
  The previous back-off algorithm wouldn't create a reasonable
  reconnect curve.  The new one is more gradual and has a configurable
  maximum ceiling.

Features:

* ConnectionFactoryBuilder
  Rather than having to build a custom subclass of
  DefaultConnectionFactory to override behaviors, you can now use a
  ConnectionFactoryBuilder to easily assemble a ConnectionFactory as
  you want it.
* Mutation-only CAS mutator
  Previously, the CASMutator required an initial object to use if the
  object you were attempting to mutate wasn't found.  Now you can
  specify this as NULL and CASMutator will *only* mutate an existing
  object, but never create a new one.
* CacheLoader
  CacheLoader provides a couple of convenient mechanisms for
  efficiently loading bulk data.  I've seen many benchmarks trying to
  see how fast data can go into memcached through the client (as
  opposed to normal usage), but they do things to make it
  unnecessarily slow.  This should satisfy both benchmarking
  requirements and legitimate bulk loading requirements.
* KetamaNodeLocator is more configurable.
  The node data ketama uses for building a hash is configurable now in
  an effort to make consistent hashing work between java and C#.

Performance Enhancements:

* Disable Nagle Algorithm by Default
  The usage of the Nagle algorithm (tcpNoDelay) is now configurable
  and is configured off by default (Nagle algorithm off = tcpNoDelay
  on).  This should be more optimal for most configurations.
* Multi-set Escalation in the Binary Protocol
  With no changes to the API, multiple sequential sets will be
  escalated into a multi-set operation similar to multi-get.  In a
  bulk load test, this is generally around 2x faster.
* Asynchronous Transcoding Service
  A transcoder can request a transcoder service (effectively a
  threadpool) to asynchronously decode cache response objects both
  outside of the API and outside of the caller thread.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:" alt="contributors"/><pre>Changes since 2.2:

    This is somewhat limited, of course, in that you obviously can't
    list all of the mappings, but you can replace many Map<String,V>
    usages with a memcached backed map.

* Failure Modes
    There are now three failure modes to choose from so you can decide
    what you want to do in the case of a node failure. (see
    FailureMode in the documentation for more details).

* Connection Observation
    You can register for callbacks that will notify you when a node
    goes up or down.  This is useful for things like notifying
    monitoring systems, or preventing a system from starting up until
    a required minimum number of memcached servers come online.

* Misc bug fixes and accessibility to memcached functionality.

Changes since 2.3:

* Fixed connection observeration.
  There was a condition where an exception could occur that wouldn't
  be tracked properly.  There's no automated test for this, but a test
  was constructed to manually verify the behavior with different
  server failure conditions.

* Fixed stat parsing for some stats.
  Tests were added to confirm that both stat responses that don't
  begin with STAT and stat values that contain spaces are handled
  correctly.

* Honor transcoder sizes.
  This adds a new requirement on the transcoder API to specify how
  many bytes the transcoder can store or read.  This both allows small
  transcoders to put size constraints in that will immediately throw
  an IllegalArgumentException when a result is too large to possibly
  work as well as allowing users to customize their memcached
  instances to allow for larger than normal objects.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:pU&amp;chl=Dustin%7cNelz" alt="contributors"/><pre>2.1rc3 includes a couple bug fixes and a convenience feature:

1) The three internal queues can be sized individually.
2) Fixed an elusive NPE in a partial read in bin.
3) Brought in Nelz' consistent hash convenience factory.

Regarding #1, it's pretty easy to overflow a read queue by having a
giant write queue such that the write queue's short commands going out
can get drained fairly quickly and set up for read, but there's no
room for the reads.  With new connection factory methods, it's both
easy to simulate that as well as size appropriately for your
application in such a way that might avoid it.  The defaults should
probably be fine for everyone, of course.

The effect of #2 was mostly that one of my tests occasionally failed.
It was a real bug though and would've sucked for someone someday.

The KetamaConnectionFactory can be used place of
DefaultConnectionFactory to get a stock ketama setup.  I don't
particularly like the KETAMA_HASH (md5), but the goal is to have a few
configurations on the shelf that one can choose from.

The initial reason for it to exist was protocol abstraction (specifically to
implement the binary protocol).  The slowness of the binary protocol release
has kept this dangling for quite a while.

Although there still isn't a released binary server, I want to get this release
out because there are a lot of other good things that have happened since:

 * CAS
 * Hash implementations and tests
 * node location algorithms (e.g. ketama consistent hashing)
 * Lots of fixes.

There are still things to do, but much of what people have been asking for can
be found within. this release and all of the bugs that have been reported
to-date have been fixed.
